                Domain names are something that every single user of the internet must interact with, but never really give it a second thought. So what exactly is a domain name then? A domain name is basically the name of the website you are trying to access. For example, if you want to search for something on the internet, you are likely to go to Google's website. The domain name for their website would be google.com. Every website that you can potentially visit has their own domain name. We use these domain names because these are like street addresses for a building, but on the internet instead. If you don't know the address, or domain name, you can't reach the website. IP addresses are technically the actual address of a website, but it is difficult for people to memorize a set of numbers that exist in IP addresses. So, domain names are used instead as an easier way to get to websites a user might be looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                That begs the question, who is in charge of keeping track of all these addresses? An organization known as ICANN is responsible for this task. ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a not-for-profit partnership that has people from all around the world work together to ensure that every website has a unique address. ICANN makes sure that the IP address for every website is different and that the domain names are as well. It would be frustrating and inefficient using the internet if multiple websites could have the same address or name. That would be as if you and your neighbor both shared the exact same street address, but lived in two different houses. How would the post office know which house the mail belongs to? In terms of the internet, imagine trying to go to Amazon to do some shopping, but instead you are taken to a website about the Amazon rain forest. The forest is nice and all, but you won't be able to do much shopping there. Therefore, it is pretty clear as to why ICANN exists and why it makes sure that every domain name and IP address is unique. Thanks to ICANN, you can be certain that when you type in amazon.com you will be able to do your shopping without any unnecessary detours!
